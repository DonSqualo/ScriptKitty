# Implementation Plan

Mittens v0.0.13 - Prioritized implementation backlog (2026-01-22).

# Very High Priority

### NanoVNA Coupled Resonator Simulation
Current `nanovna.rs` uses Wheeler formula with frequency-dependent corrections. Still no connection to actual geometry for inductance computation.

**Now Implemented:**
- Wheeler formula + Nagaoka correction for inductance
- Skin effect: `R_ac = R_dc·√(1 + (ω/ω_skin)²)` for frequency-dependent resistance
- Parasitic capacitance between turns (Medhurst approximation)
- Self-resonant frequency (SRF) calculation: `f_SRF = 1/(2π√(LC_parasitic))`
- Mutual inductance M via Neumann formula for coaxial loops
- Coupled impedance: `Z_in = jωL_drive + (ωM)²/(R_res + jωL_res)` for sharp Q peaks
- S11 conversion with frequency-dependent impedance

**Still Missing:**
- No geometry-aware inductance (reads hardcoded params, not actual mesh)
- No sample environment coupling (biological tissue ε_r ≈ 80)

**Remaining Roadmap:**
1. **Geometry-Aware Inductance**: Extract coil coordinates from mesh, compute L from field energy `L = 2W_m/I²`
2. **Sample Coupling**: Model biological tissue effects on resonator Q

(No current items)

# Medium Priority

### Circuit Simulation (SPICE-like)
`circuit.rs` now has AC analysis in addition to SVG diagram generation.
**Implemented:** analyze_circuit_ac() computes S11, power transfer, voltage gain
**Could add:** Transient analysis, node voltages, current through each component
