study @implementation_plan.md
(it may be incorrect) and is to use up to 500 subagents to study existing source code in and compare it against the specifications. From that create/update a @implementation_plan.md which is a bullet point list sorted in priority of the items which have yet to be implemeneted. Think extra hard and use the oracle to plan. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations and placeholders.
